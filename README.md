Repo organization:
------------------------------------------------

- Each essay has a corresponding branch.  Nothing is pushed to main/master.  Indeed this method of branching is not typical behavior for most dev projects, but I find this model a useful way to organize for me, at least for this project.

- Examples: 

--- Essay 6 Text: https://symbolmanipulation.substack.com/p/essay-6-a-better-benchmark-for-hierarchical
--- Essay 6 Code: https://github.com/kyle-binder-essays/essay_repo1/tree/essay_06

--- Essay 8 Text: https://symbolmanipulation.substack.com/p/essay-8-a-model-of-100-years-of-usa
--- Essay 8 Code: https://github.com/kyle-binder-essays/essay_repo1/tree/essay_08

If in doubt, the text of each essay also contains a link to that essay's data & code.
